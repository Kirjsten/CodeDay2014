Some notes about the files contained in this folder....

In the first folder: Business Plans-Guides(Templates)
	My mom gave me a few templates and guide lines. 
	Although they are from another country, they still give pretty good advice.
	It's still a good place to start.
	There are a few different kinds in there.
	Each template has a guide.

In the second folder: Logo
	I created a higher quality image of the logo with the clear background
	I included the light, dark, saturated, and original looks to the logo.
	I thought it would be a good to included the different ideas I had while recreating it.

Some final words....
	I hope this helps in the next meeting. 
	I'm sorry if I miss a lot of information and planning.
	Also, feel free to criticize the logo. 
	The more criticism, the better it will look.
